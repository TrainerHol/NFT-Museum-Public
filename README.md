# NFT Museum

This is a WIP project based around the idea of Â creating a dynamic NFT that reacts to the user's wallet and displays the different artworks contained in said wallet. The project is being built using Unity/C# and published on WebGL.

The goal of the project is to have an affordable alternative to virtual land/galleries that are more user-centric and contained in a decentralized storage system instead of the centralized and expensive alternatives currently available.

The project currently uses the OpenSea API to pull information of each artwork.
